## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built using React.js for both the frontend and backend, with MongoDB serving as the database. The project is designed to demonstrate a complete web application with a modern JavaScript stack.

## Features

- **Frontend**: 
  - Developed with React.js, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
  - State management using React Hooks.
  - Styled components for modular and reusable styling.

- **Backend**: 
  - Also built with React.js, leveraging Node.js for server-side logic.
  - RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations.
  - Integration with MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.

- **Database**:
  - MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is used to store and manage application data.
  - Mongoose is used as an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library to interact with MongoDB.

## Project Structure

```
/client                 # Frontend code
  /src
    /components         # Reusable React components
    /pages              # Page components (e.g., Home, About, Dashboard)
    /styles             # CSS/Sass files or styled-components
    App.js              # Main React component
    index.js            # Entry point for React
/server                 # Backend code
  /controllers          # Route controllers for handling requests
  /models               # Mongoose models for MongoDB collections
  /routes               # Express routes
  server.js             # Entry point for the backend server
  config.js             # Configuration files (e.g., DB connection)
```

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (locally or a cloud-based solution like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/full-stack-project.git
   cd full-stack-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install dependencies for the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory.
   - Add your MongoDB connection string and other necessary environment variables:
     ```bash
     MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
     PORT=5000
     ```

### Running the Project

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the frontend development server**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

- The application allows users to perform various CRUD operations through a user-friendly interface.
- Data is persisted in MongoDB, and all operations are handled via RESTful API endpoints.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js
  - React Router
  - Axios (for API calls)

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - Mongoose

- **Database**:
  - MongoDB

## Future Enhancements

- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Add unit and integration tests.
- Deploy the application using Docker.
